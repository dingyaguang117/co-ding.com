**What is SendFriend?**

SendFriend is a startup focused on improving cross-border payments.
The team is from World Bank and MoneyGram. SendFriend is a partner of Ripple.

This new generation remittance company focuses on the smartest way to send money to the Philippines, which will help overseas Filipino workers safely transfer dollars to PHP via SendFriend at the lowest possible fee.

**What’s the pain point in cross-border payments?**

Immigrants in the United States who send money the old-fashioned way often face delay, high fees, and sometimes can't get through.

The high fee is the most important one. The size of remittances in the United States is $650 billion, and the transaction fees reached $45 billion.

**How does SendFriend improve the remittance?**

SendFriend uses Ripple's xRapid payment solution to facilitate cross-border payments. XRP provides the liquidity needed for transactions. xRapid transaction is to convert dollars into XRP, which is then sent via an exchange, bypassing banks and financial institutions, and then convert XRP back into PHP via an exchange in the Philippines. SendFriend has reduced the cost of service by 65% from the industry average.
