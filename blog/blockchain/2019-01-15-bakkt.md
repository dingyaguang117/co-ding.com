Bakkt’s ambition is not just to be a trading platform, they want to bring cryptocurrency to consumer-grade payment field. And they cooperate with Starbucks to implement the first scenario.

**What is different?**

- Backed by ICE, and attracted many big-name partners like Microsoft, Starbucks and BCG.

- ICE is already a CFTC-registered “designated contract market”, it has ability to “self-certify” a futures product for listing without prior CFTC approval. It just has to file its paper first.

- Bakkt bitcoin futures contact is physically-settled.

- Cater to regulators. All bitcoin trades on Bakkt will be fully prefunded, and no leveraged trading and margin trading.

**What is the meaning?**

- Backed by ICE, attracted enormous funding from traditional financial industry. That's positive for the market.

- First institutional grade regulated exchange, clearing and warehousing services for physical delivery and storage. Cryptocurrency market will be formalized gradually.

- Bakkt’s infrastrucure will acclerate the application implementation of cryptocurrency.

- Physically-settled means reducing supply of bitcoin, maybe increase price.

**Conclusion**

Bakkt will be the go-to platform for various financial institutions to trade cryptocurrency securely, and it certainly could be the catalyst for the next large cryptocurrency bull run.
